Project Title: FAKE IMAGE IDENTIFICATION IN SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM
Objectives of project:
The main goal of this project is to create and develop a model that will be able to recognize and identify whether the image that is uploaded is fake or real. 
This model is built using machine learning. This model will help monitor social media platforms and detect whether an image is fake or real.
The proposed model is built using machine learning. 
Convolution Neural Networks(CNN) is used for building the model using tensorflow and keras. 
I have implemented a user interface using flask, a web application framework written in python, HTML and CSS.
We aim to develop a model capable of detecting the fake images as fake and real images as real rapidly and correctly.
Get high accuracy and validation on the testing and training images.
Implement the network architecture to find the best model with perfect results.
Training high dataset with different types of images like face images, animal images, birdâ€™s images, and other object images.
The goal is to provide social media platforms with a reliable tool to automatically detect and mitigate the impact of fake images, enhancing user trust and ensuring a more secure online environment.
